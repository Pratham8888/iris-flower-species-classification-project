# iris-flower-species-classification-project
Our mission is to build a machine learning model that acts like a botanist's assistant.  The Goal: To train a model that can automatically identify the correct species of an Iris flower (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) just by being given the measurements of its petals and sepals.  
Imagine a scientist finds a new Iris flower in the wild. Instead of identifying it manually, they could measure it, feed the measurements to our model, and the model would tell them the species.

The Data We Are Using
To achieve this goal, we are using a famous, real-world dataset collected by botanist Edgar Anderson in the 1930s. It's the record of his measurements for 150 Iris flowers.

For each of the 150 flowers, he recorded four things (these are our features or inputs):

The length of its sepal (the green leaf-like part that encloses the bud).

The width of its sepal.

The length of its petal (the colorful part).

The width of its petal.

He also recorded the correct species for each flower (this is our target or the "right answer" we want the model to learn to predict):

Iris setosa

Iris versicolor

Iris virginica
