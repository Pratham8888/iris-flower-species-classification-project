# iris-flower-species-classification-project
Our mission is to build a machine learning model that acts like a botanist's assistant.  The Goal: To train a model that can automatically identify the correct species of an Iris flower (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) just by being given the measurements of its petals and sepals.
